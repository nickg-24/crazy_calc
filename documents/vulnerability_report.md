# Crazy Calculatorz Vulnerability Report

The goal specific goal of this step is to produce a technical writeup that explains the vulnerability, provides steps to replicate the vulnerability, and a Selenium script that provides the existence of the vulnerability.

## Introduction
Crazy Calculatorz is a place for calculation enthusiasts to go to share their love of calculating. Aside from the inherent file system exposure through the PUT and DELETE methods, there are two main vulnerabilities present in Crazy Calculatorz: Cross-Site Scripting and PHP injection.

### Cross-Site Scripting

#### What is Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)?
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is a web security vulnerability where an attacker injects malicious scripts (often JavaScript) into web pages viewed by others. These scripts execute in the victims browser and can be used to perform a wide range of damaging actions from identity theft to malware infection. The most common types of XSS are reflected and stored. These vulnerabilities arise due to lack of proper input and output validation/sanitization of user generated data.

Reflected XSS is when an attacker tricks a victim into making a malicious request without their knowledge. This often occurs through a specially crafted link or URL. In this scenario, the injected script is "reflected" off a web server and executed in the victim's browser when they click the link or visit the compromised URL. 

Stored XSS involves an attacker injecting malicious scripts directly into a website's database or storage. These scripts are then served to other users when they access the affected web page. Stored XSS attacks can have long-lasting effects, as the injected script remains on the server until it's removed.

#### Steps to Replicate
The XSS vulnerability is present in the "Enter Name" text input on the "calculator.html" page.
