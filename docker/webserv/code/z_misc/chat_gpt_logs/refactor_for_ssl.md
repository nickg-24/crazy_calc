**You:**

Here is a main method i wrote for a very basic python web server. it uses sockets. can you refactor my code so that it properly handles ssl? Here are some requirements that I mostly followed (aside from the fact that ssl is not implemented:


Your server should have exactly four command line arguments:

    The IP address to listen on.

    The port to listen on.
    A path to an x509 (.pem or .crt file) file to use for HTTPS encryption. If this is not provided, you may assume that HTTP is to be used rather than HTTPS.
        An HTTPS request if no PEM is specified (ie: HTTPS is not enabled) should be handled gracefully. You may determine how to handle that case. One example may be to return an HTTP 500 response code.
        You do not need to enforce the file extensions above
    A path to the private key paired with the x509 certificate.
        The server should not execute if the third argument is included but not the fourth argument.


Here is my main method:
def main():
    ip_addr = sys.argv[1]
    port = int(sys.argv[2])

    print(f'{ip_addr}:{port}') # debug comment

    # if there are 5 args, then all args have been provided
    is_https = len(sys.argv) == 5

    # if cert and key are present, it is https
    if is_https:
        cert_path = sys.argv[3]
        pk_path = sys.argv[4]
        print(f'\n {cert_path} \n {pk_path}') # debug comment
    print("is https=" , is_https) # debug comment


    # if its not https, open standard socket
    if not is_https:
        # listen on specified ip and port
        s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
        s.bind((ip_addr, port))
        s.listen(5)
        while True:
            client, address = s.accept()
            client_handler = threading.Thread(target=handle_client, args=(client,))
            client_handler.start()

    # if it is https, open https socket
    if is_https:
        print('do the same thing but will ssl')
        print('work in progress')

**ChatGPT:**

To refactor your code to handle SSL, you'll need to:


- Import necessary modules.
- Modify the socket creation and connection processes to wrap the socket with an SSL context when the server is in HTTPS mode.
- Handle the scenario where the third argument (x509 certificate) is given, but the fourth (private key) is missing.
- Make sure that HTTPS is only used when both the certificate and private key are provided.

Here's a refactored version of your `main()` function:

import sys
import socket
import threading
import ssl

def main():
    if len(sys.argv) < 3:
        print("Usage: server.py <ip> <port> [cert_path] [key_path]")
        sys.exit(1)

    ip_addr = sys.argv[1]
    port = int(sys.argv[2])
    print(f'{ip_addr}:{port}')  # debug comment

    cert_path = None
    pk_path = None
    if len(sys.argv) >= 4:
        cert_path = sys.argv[3]
    if len(sys.argv) == 5:
        pk_path = sys.argv[4]
    elif len(sys.argv) == 4 and not pk_path:
        print("Error: Cert path provided without private key path.")
        sys.exit(1)

    is_https = bool(cert_path and pk_path)
    print("is https=" , is_https)  # debug comment

    s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
    s.bind((ip_addr, port))
    s.listen(5)

    if is_https:
        context = ssl.create_default_context(ssl.Purpose.CLIENT_AUTH)
        context.load_cert_chain(certfile=cert_path, keyfile=pk_path)

    while True:
        client, address = s.accept()
        if is_https:
            client = context.wrap_socket(client, server_side=True)
        client_handler = threading.Thread(target=handle_client, args=(client,))
        client_handler.start()

def handle_client(client):
    # TODO: Your client handling code here
    pass

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()

```
Here's a summary of the changes made:


- Imported the `ssl` module.
- Introduced the `context` object for SSL, which is created if in HTTPS mode.
- Loaded the given certificate and private key into the `context`.
- Wrapped the client socket with this `context` if in HTTPS mode.
- Handled the scenario where a certificate path is given without a private key.
- Removed duplicated socket initialization code.

You should also implement your `handle_client` function to handle the incoming client requests, possibly returning an HTTP 500 response if the client tries to connect via HTTPS when the server is in HTTP mode.
